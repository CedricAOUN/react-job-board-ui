# react-job-board-ui
Front-End of my React job board app. You may visit it here: [https://react-job-board-ui.vercel.app/](https://react-job-board-ui.vercel.app/) *NOTE: For all functionalities, this website app needs a backend server. You can set one up easily with the Docker files I have setup, by following the instructions*

## Install
This app requires a MySQL Server and database to access all of its features. Please install the [back-end](https://github.com/CedricAOUN/react-job-board-backend/tree/main) *(Instructions provided in the README of that repository)*
