# react-job-board-ui
Front-End of my React job board app. This is designed to work with [react-job-board-backend](https://github.com/CedricAOUN/react-job-board-backend/tree/main)

## Install Guide
**Please start by installing the [back-end](https://github.com/CedricAOUN/react-job-board-backend/tree/main)** *(Instructions provided in the README of that repository)*

Download and extract this repository as a seperate folder from where you installed the backend.

- Open a new Terminal/CMD(different from the one you used for the Back-end) in this folder. (.../react-job-board-ui)
- Type "npm install" and wait for the packages to finish installing.
- Type "npm run dev"

Your UI should be up and running with the following in your Terminal/CMD:

```

  VITE v4.3.9  ready in --- ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h to show help

```

You should now have 2 Terminals/CMDs open, one with the server.js, and one with UI.

You may now visit: [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) and test out my application!
